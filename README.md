## I build interfaces that demand attention.
From experimental stages to pixel-perfect production, I craft immersive, high-fidelity digital experiences for screens of every shape. I’m a frontend engineer with a creative soul and a cinematic edge—designing UI that *feels* like something.

## PROJECTS

### **Hulu’s OMITB - Game of War - Interactive Card Battle Engine**  
**Sept 2025**  
- **Battle Engine**: Designed modular game logic via `useWarLogic` and `useWarBattleLogic` hooks to handle state transitions, war conditions, and victory checks with precise state machines.  
- **Event Bus Architecture**: Implemented a scoped `useAnimationBus` and `useMessageBus` system to orchestrate GSAP-based animations across isolated components without prop drilling.  
- **Rich UX**: Built an immersive UI in `GameBoard` with animated card reveals, dynamic deck states, and modal-driven war resolution, emphasizing player feedback and clarity.  
- **Telemetry Layer**: Added `useElementTelemetry` to track user interactions by DOM attribute, enabling future analytics or A/B testing instrumentation.

### **Xulf - Low Code Website Builder - Codebase**  
**Ongoing**  
- **Drag-and-Drop WYSIWYG Canvas**: Architected a recursive rendering engine with custom DnD logic (built on `@dnd-kit/core`) for deeply nestable, reorderable layout modules using a centralized `DndProvider` context and live `ResolvedModuleInstance` trees.  
- **Logic Graph Editor**: Created a visual programming layer using React Flow where module functions (e.g. `Button.onClick → Modal.open`) are represented as drag-in nodes, stored as JSON in `SiteJSON.functions`, and resolved via a centralized function registry.  
- **Live Prop Editor + Metadata Generation**: Built a dynamic prop panel with modal-based `customStyles` editing and enum dropdowns, backed by a `ModulePropsMap` auto-generated from source using custom AST tooling via `generate-editor-meta.ts`.  
- **Monorepo Structure (Nx)**: Engineered a clean Nx-based monorepo with isolated `modules/`, `editor-ui/`, `backend/`, and `db/` libraries, enabling composable module libraries with editor UIs, preview renderers, and prop/function contracts bundled per module.

### **The World’s Largest Tailgate, Kansas City Chiefs - Staging Site**  
**Sept 2024**  
A fully responsive live streaming page provides an immersive experience across phones, tablets, and desktops, featuring interactive elements like an AR photo booth with live preview, and customizable overlays. Post-event content, quizzes, and polling interfaces enhance audience engagement, ensuring a dynamic, high-quality experience.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### **Frontend Software Engineer**  
**Little Cinema Digital** — *New York, NY*  
**Apr. 2024 – Current**  
- Became a core contributor to an internal web platform still in active development, stress-testing its limits while influencing architectural decisions through structured feedback and hands-on implementation.  
- Built modular, reusable React components optimized for live-event tooling and content delivery at scale—serving experiences for clients like HBO, Amazon, and Netflix.  
- Led initiatives to standardize frontend patterns, improve component ergonomics, and reduce cognitive overhead across the codebase.

### **Tech-Lead / Founder**  
**Morrison Developers** — *New York, NY*  
**Oct. 2024 – Current**  
Founded Morrison Developers to build ambitious, one-off software solutions that bridge custom design with powerful engineering. As the technical and strategic lead, I architected Xulf, a modular web builder and editor designed to make it easy to compose rich, interactive sites from reusable components—comparable to modern internal tools like Webflow, but fully programmable and extensible.
